## Raft Consensus Algorithm In Python

* This repo is an implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm. This was developed as part of the " CATALOG NODE RUNNER HACKATHON" organised by [Catalog](https://catalog.fi/)
* The algorithm was implemented based on the paper written by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout at Stanford University. Refer here for the document: [In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf)
* The ```node.py``` file contains the classes and different fuctions and variables defined for the protocol. 
* Each of the api file can be launched as a new node or a system.
